# The template project for ESTNeT

This is a template project that simplifies the creation of new projects that use the ESTNeT library.

For more infos on how to install ESTNeT, see the [installation instructions](https://github.com/estnet-framework/estnet/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

After this, the template can be imported to your OMNeTt++ workspace. If you added ESTNeT and INET to the same workspace,
the projects should be recognized automatically by the template project. 
Then build it and run the standard omnetpp.ini simulation to verify everything works.

You can rename the template project to your new project name. Different scenarios can be tested by adding your own custom .ini files.
In order to add your own custom modules, you'll need to add your code to the src directory.

The template also comes with the ability to [create basic contact and interference plans](https://github.com/estnet-framework/estnet/blob/master/HOWTO.md).
